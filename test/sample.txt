This is a sample document for testing the document upload and chunking functionality.

The document contains multiple paragraphs to test the chunking process. Each paragraph should be properly split and processed.

Here's another paragraph with some specific information about our AI agents. They are capable of natural language understanding and can handle various customer service scenarios effectively.

This system uses advanced natural language processing to understand customer queries and respond appropriately. The responses are generated based on the knowledge base that has been built from uploaded documents.

When a document is uploaded, it goes through several processing steps:
1. Initial validation and storage
2. Text extraction based on file type
3. Splitting into manageable chunks
4. Storage in the knowledge base
5. Association with the specific agent

Each chunk is stored with proper metadata including the source document and the agent it belongs to. This ensures proper organization and retrieval of information.
